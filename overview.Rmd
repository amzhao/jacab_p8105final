<font size="3">It is expected that when it comes to emergency medical services (EMS), faster is always better. Most EMS operations aim to have a response time of 8 minute or less for advanced life support (ALS) units responding to life-threatening events.

In 2018, it was estimated that ~46 percent of ambulance responses to serious emergencies took longer than 10 minutes in NYC. The City of New York spends more than $1.1 billion annually to provide EMS services to the city, however the money is often not used wisely. However, with some conflicting reports claiming that an 8 minute or less response time may not improve health outcomes it calls into question whether a response time <8 min is important and if we should we allocate more funds to reduce NYC response times?"

This study proposed to assess the association between NYC EMS response time and mortality. A detailed explanation of the findings and conclusions of this project can be found in the Project Report, [here](report.html).


<h2> Dataset </h2>

We used the [EMS Incident Dispatch Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/EMS-Incident-Dispatch-Data/76xm-jjuj) dataset, generated by the EMS Computer Aided Dispatch System. The data was obtained from NYC Open Data.
The data spans from the time the incident is created in the system to the time the incident is closed in the system. It covers information about the incident as it relates to the assignment of resources and the Fire Departmentâ€™s response to the emergency.
