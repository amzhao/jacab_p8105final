### Tentative Project Title:

  - “Help\! I’ve Fallen and Can’t Get Up”: EMS Response Times in NYC

### Motivation for Project:

It is expected that when it comes to emergency medical services (EMS),
faster is *always* better. Most EMS operations aim to have a response
time of 8 minute or less for advanced life support (ALS) units
responding to life-threatening events.

In 2018, it was estimated that ~46 percent of ambulance responses to
serious emergencies took longer than 10 minutes in NYC. The City of New
York spends more than $1.1 billion annually to provide EMS services to
the city, however the money is often not used wisely. However, with some
conflicting reports claiming that an 8 minute or less response time may
not improve health outcomes it calls into question whether a response
time \<8 min is important and if we should we allocate more funds to
reduce NYC response times?"

This study seeks to assess the association between NYC EMS response time
and mortality.

### Intended Final Products:

  - Written Report
  - Webpage
  - Two-Minute Narrated Screencast
  - Peer Assessment

### Anticipated Data Sources:

##### NYC EMS DATA:

  - EMS incident Dispatch Data generated by the EMS Computer Aided
    Dispatch System - obtained from NYC Open Data.
    <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/EMS-Incident-Dispatch-Data/76xm-jjuj>

  - Possible variables: INITIAL\_SEVERITY\_LEVEL\_CODE,
    FINAL\_SEVERITY\_LEVEL\_CODE, DISPATCH\_RESPONSE\_SECONDS\_QY,
    INCIDENT\_TRAVEL\_TM\_SECONDS\_QY, HELD\_INDICATOR, BOROUGH,
    ZIPCODE, Incident Disposition Code (83)

##### NYC CENSUS DATA:

  - NYC Census Data to obtain demographic measures at the
    zipcode/borough level

### Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges:

  - Main outcome: Death upon arrivals (Binary)

  - Main exposure: EMS Response times (Continous)

**Analysis Plan:**

  - Read in the dataset

  - Limit dataset by year

  - Clean dataset (e.g. rename variables according to good naming
    conventions, factoring ordinal variables, etc)

  - Create new variables

  - Look at descriptive measures (tables)

  - Visualize the relationship between key variables

  - Model key relationships and assess significance

  - Describe data/analysis limitations

**Visualizations:**

  - Heat map of call count by zip code

  - Line graph of call count by year grouping by type of call

  - Boxplot: distribution of deaths by borough

  - Scatterplot of time of response by number of deaths on arrival

**Coding Challenges:**

  - Importing 8.5M rows will take a long time (we will then limit)

  - Preparing/recoding/ordering variables for graphing and modelling
    purposes
