<font size="3">It is expected that when it comes to emergency medical services (EMS), faster is always better. Most EMS operations aim to have a response time of 8 minute or less for advanced life support (ALS) units responding to life-threatening events.

In 2018, it was estimated that ~46 percent of ambulance responses to serious emergencies took longer than 10 minutes in NYC. The City of New York spends more than $1.1 billion annually to provide EMS services to the city, however the money is often not used wisely. However, with some conflicting reports claiming that an 8 minute or less response time may not improve health outcomes it calls into question whether a response time <8 min is important and if we should we allocate more funds to reduce NYC response times?"

This study proposed to assess the association between NYC EMS response time and mortality. A detailed explanation of the findings and conclusions of this project can be found in the Project Report, [here](report_web.html)</font>
