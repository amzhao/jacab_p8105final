*note: The title of this project is a line from a commercial that has been [memed](https://www.google.com/search?q=life+alert+meme&sxsrf=ACYBGNQqIvW74KMRbdauXsERsqWnXo-X_Q:1575226120265&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiWjdvKjpXmAhVHq1kKHccFBD8Q_AUoAXoECAsQAw&biw=1130&bih=1257) and is often the subject of jokes. It is in no way meant to trivialize the emergencies experienced by 911 callers or the work of EMS responders.
