FINAL â€“ need to convert to plotly

``` r
ems_data_clean%>%
select(arrival_outcome, neighbourhood, month, borough) %>%
group_by (arrival_outcome, neighbourhood, month, borough) %>% 
drop_na(arrival_outcome) %>% 
summarise_(n_death = ~n()) %>%
filter(arrival_outcome == "dead") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = n_death, group = neighbourhood, color = neighbourhood)) + 
  geom_line() + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Factor `arrival_outcome` contains implicit NA, consider using
    ## `forcats::fct_explicit_na`

    ## Warning: summarise_() is deprecated. 
    ## Please use summarise() instead
    ## 
    ## The 'programming' vignette or the tidyeval book can help you
    ## to program with summarise() : https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org
    ## This warning is displayed once per session.
