FINAL -- need to convert to plotly 
```{r}

select(arrival_outcome, neighbourhood, month, borough) %>%
group_by (arrival_outcome, neighbourhood, month, borough) %>% 
drop_na(arrival_outcome) %>%

filter(arrival_outcome == "dead") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = n_death, group = neighbourhood, color = neighbourhood)) + 
  geom_line() + geom_point()
```

Severity Code by Time, Grouped by Neighborhood 
```{r}
ems_data_clean%>%
  select(neighbourhood, initial_severity_level_code, incident_travel_tm_seconds_qy) %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood, initial_severity_level_code) %>% 
  summarize(mean_time = mean(incident_travel_tm_seconds_qy)) %>%

```

```{r}

  group_by(arrival_outcome) %>% 
  drop_na(arrival_outcome) %>%
  summarize(mean_time = mean(incident_travel_tm_seconds_qy)) 
```


Logistic Regression Model 
```{r}
ems_data_clean %>% 
    mutate(
    initial_severity_level_code = fct_relevel(initial_severity_level_code, "1")) %>%
    select(incident_travel_tm_seconds_qy, initial_severity_level_code, neighbourhood)

model = glm(arrival_outcome ~ incident_travel_tm_seconds_qy + initial_severity_level_code + neighbourhood, data = ems_data_clean, family = binomial())

model %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

res.aov <- aov(incident_travel_tm_seconds_qy ~ neighbourhood, data = ems_data_clean)
summary(res.aov) 
# Because the p-value is less than 0.05, we know there are statistically significant differneces between the incident travel time in seconds between neighborhoods.
